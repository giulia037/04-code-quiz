# 04-code-quiz
For this activity I started with a basic HTML file by using the HTML-5 code. From there I looked back on a few in class projects and a few youtube videos. After that I started building my javascript. I started with putting my questions into an array. Then I took that array and said after a question in clicked we should see the next question pop up. I took what I was given in the assignment and broke it down into a to do list. Then all I had to do was finish the css to look the way I wanted it to look and then I was done.
