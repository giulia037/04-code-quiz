# 04-code-quiz
For this activity I started with a basic HTML file by using the HTML-5 code. From there I looked back on a few in class projects and a few youtube videos. After that I was able to finish bulding my CSS and my JAVA. I unfortunatly found out I forgot to link my github to my code. So to fix that I dragged my folder into my working projects and then created another file into my 04-challenge. After I did that I simply just dragged my HTML,JAVA, and CSS into that new folder that was connected to github.
